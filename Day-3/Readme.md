# DAY 3 : Object Detection Methods with CNNs

## Lecture -1 Topics: 
* Introduction to Object Detection
* Dataset and Performance metrics
* Object Detection Strategies
* Classification and Localization
* RCNN family of object detectors
* How to create a dataset for Object Detection?

## Lecture -2 Topics:
* Strategies for predicting bounding boxes
* NMS and Anchor Boxes
* Case studies:
  - Yolo Family
  - SSD
  - State of the art

## Hands-on/Lab session:
* Object Detection Using YoloV5
* Download the dataset using this link: [Kangaroo Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O7v0NV0_ILIpDoZ5kZHzI-jmvA2zHQNF/view?usp=sharing)
* **Reference:** How to train YoloV9 on Custom Dataset: [Train YoloV9 on Custom Dataset](https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/train-yolov9-object-detection-on-custom-dataset.ipynb)

### Instructions for Hands-on session:
* Download the dataset and iPython Notebooks
* Create a Folder named: "Hokkaido Uni DL"-->"/Day-3" on your Google Drive or storage attached to your Google Colab
* Upload the iPython Notebooks and datasets into the 'Day-1'
* We are now Ready to start with the first notebook NB1
