## Course Objectives:
This course aims to introduce students to the fundamentals of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their applications in Computer Vision. By the end of the course, students will be able to understand and implement CNNs for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation tasks.

## Course goals:
The course seeks to provide a strong foundation in CNN architectures and their use in various image processing tasks. Students will gain hands-on experience in building, training, and evaluating CNN models for real-world applications such as classifying images, detecting objects, and segmenting images.

## What will participants learn?
* Introduction to AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision fundamentals.
* Understand the difference between traditional machine learning and Deep Learning.
* Able to Build, Train, and Test a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch.
* Learn to use libraries and framework for implementing Deep CNN architectures.
* Able to create custom architectures for Image Classification using CNNs
* Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation using CNNs
