## Course Objectives:
This course aims to introduce students to the fundamentals of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their applications in Computer Vision. By the end of the course, students will be able to understand and implement CNNs for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation tasks.

## Course goals:
The course seeks to provide a strong foundation in CNN architectures and their use in various image processing tasks. Students will gain hands-on experience in building, training, and evaluating CNN models for real-world applications such as classifying images, detecting objects, and segmenting images.

## Course Schedule:
* Day 1 | Tuesday, Nov 26  : Introduction, Image Processing & NN Basics - 2 Lectures
* Day 2 | Wednesday, Nov 27: CNN Basics and Image Classification Techniques - 2 Lectures
* Day 3 | Thursday, Nov 28 : Object Detection Methods with CNNs - 2 Lectures
* Day 4 | Friday, Nov 27   : Image Segmentation and Advanced Topics in CNNs - 2 Lectures
* Day 5 | Monday, Dec 02   : Case Studies

## Evaluation:
* Task 1: Image Classification on a public dataset (Multi-class classification) 
* Task 2: Object Detection on a small public dataset (Multi-Object)
* Deliverable: Report, (Template will be shared)
  
* Introduction to AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision fundamentals.
